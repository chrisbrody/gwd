                    truly succeed online, you need to make sure that your website is
                    visible to your target audience. And that's where Search Engine

                </p>
                <p>

                    engine results pages (SERPs), like Google, Bing, and others. When your
                    website ranks higher, more people are likely to find it, which can lead
                    to increased traffic, leads, and sales.

                    <h2>Understanding the Fundamentals: How Search Engines Work</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before diving into the specific SEO techniques, it's helpful to
                        understand how search engines work. Search engines like Google use
                        complex algorithms to crawl the web, index content, and rank websites
                        based on a variety of factors. Here's a simplified overview:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Crawling:</b> Search engine bots (also known as "spiders") crawl
                            the web, following links from page to page to discover new content.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Indexing:</b> Once a page is crawled, it's added to the search
                            engine's index, a massive database of all the websites on the
                            internet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Ranking:</b> When a user performs a search, the search engine
                            uses its algorithm to determine which pages in its index are the
                            most relevant to the search query and then ranks them in order of
                            relevance.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        SEO is all about influencing these three stages to improve your
                        website's visibility and ranking.

                    <h3>On-Page SEO: Optimizing Your Website Content</h3>

                        on-page SEO factors include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                            SEMrush to find relevant keywords with high search volume and low
                            competition.

                            for each page on your website. Title tags are displayed in search

                            descriptions are displayed below the title tag in search results and
                            can influence click-through rates.
