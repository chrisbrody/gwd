                    <h2>Understanding the Basics: What are AI Chatbots?</h2>
                    <p>
                        At their core, AI-powered chatbots are computer programs designed to
                        simulate conversations with human users. Unlike traditional
                        rule-based chatbots, which rely on pre-programmed responses to
                        specific keywords or phrases, AI chatbots leverage artificial
                        intelligence technologies, such as natural language processing (NLP)
                        and machine learning (ML), to understand the intent behind user
                        queries and provide more relevant and personalized responses.

                            <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</b> NLP enables chatbots to
                            understand and interpret human language, including its nuances,
                            context, and intent.

                        <li>
                            <b>Machine Learning (ML):</b> ML allows chatbots to learn from data
                            and improve their performance over time. By analyzing user
                            interactions, chatbots can identify patterns, refine their
                            responses, and become more effective at resolving customer
                            inquiries.
